\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
It does not matter whether you
enter one or several     spaces
after a word.

An empty line starts a new
paragraph.

    Whitespace at the start of a line is generally ignored, and a single
    line break is treated as ``whitespace''.


Several empty lines are treated


as one empty line.
