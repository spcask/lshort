\section{Euler's Identity}
In mathematics, Euler's identity is the equality
\[ e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0. \]

\subsection{Explanation}
Euler's identity is a special case of Euler's formula from complex
analysis, which states that for any real number \( x \),
\begin{equation}
e^{ix} = \cos x + i \sin x.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Significance}
Euler's identity is often cited as an example of deep mathematical
beauty. Three of the basic arithmetic operations occur exactly once
each: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. The identity also
links five fundamental mathematical constants.

Euler's identity is named after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler.
It is considered to be an exemplar of mathematical beauty as it shows a
profound connection between the most fundamental numbers in mathematics.
